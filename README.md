# Building-Performance-ML-2025
# Building Performance Prediction with Machine Learning
This repository contains code for a study submitted to *Building and Environment*, evaluating six ML models (RF, XGBoost, etc.) for predicting building performance metrics (PEC, CO2, IAQ, PPD, VDH) using 1,826 synthetic configurations.

## Files
- `train_models.py`: Trains and evaluates ML models.
- `plot_residuals.py`: Generates violin and scatter plots for residuals.
- `scenario_analysis.py`: Performs scenario comparisons.
- `data/sample_data.csv`: Sample dataset (100 rows).
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run `train_models.py` to train models.
3. Use `plot_residuals.py` for visualizations.

## Notes
Full dataset is not shared due to size constraints. Contact [f.dehghan@alumnos.upm.es] for details.
