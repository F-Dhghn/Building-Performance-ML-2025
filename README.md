# Machine Learning for Building Performance Prediction

This repository contains the code and a sample dataset for a study submitted to *Building and Environment*. The study evaluates six machine learning regression models—Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Linear Regression (LR)—to predict five building performance metrics: Primary Energy Consumption (PEC, kWh), CO₂-equivalent Emissions (kg), Indoor Air Quality (IAQ, ppm), Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD, %), and Visual Discomfort Hours (VDH, hr). Using a synthetic dataset of 1,826 design configurations with 25 input variables, RF and XGBoost achieved test R² values of 0.816–0.959, outperforming other models.
