Evaluating Machine Learning Models for Sustainable Building Design: Energy, Emissions, and Comfort Metrics
Abstract
This study assesses six machine learning regression models—Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Linear Regression (LR)—for predicting building performance in a 79.35 m² residential unit in Sari, Iran (ASHRAE Zone 3A). The EnergyPlus model, calibrated with three years of utility data (2021–2023) per ASHRAE Guideline 14-2014, used a synthetic dataset of 1,826 configurations with 25 input variables. Five metrics were evaluated: Primary Energy Consumption (kWh), CO₂-equivalent Emissions (kg), Indoor Air Quality (IAQ, ppm), Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD, %), and Visual Discomfort Hours (VDH, hr). The dataset was split into 60% training and 40% testing sets, with performance measured by RMSE, R², and MAPE. RF and XGBoost excelled, achieving test R² values of 0.9188–0.9578, reducing RMSE by up to 31% compared to LR (R²: 0.35–0.50). Hyperparameter tuning via Grid Search and Bayesian Optimization improved accuracy, with XGBoost reaching an R² of 0.9578 for IAQ. Sensitivity and SHAP analyses highlighted ventilation and HVAC as key drivers. Scenario analysis with 1,000 bootstrap iterations showed trade-offs: increased ventilation increased energy use by 110.7% and emissions by 76.2% but improved IAQ by 20.3%. Optimization reduced energy consumption by 34.3% and emissions by 38.1%, enhancing comfort. RF and XGBoost are robust for sustainable building design optimization.

Adaptive Machine Learning Framework for Multi-Objective Building Performance Optimization Under Future Climate Scenarios
Abstract
Climate change poses significant challenges to building performance, necessitating adaptive strategies to optimize energy efficiency, emissions, and occupant comfort under evolving conditions. This study introduces a machine learning framework leveraging transfer learning to predict and optimize five key building performance indicators— Primary Energy Consumption (PEC, kWh), CO₂-equivalent Emissions (kg), Indoor Air Quality (IAQ, ppm), Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD, %), and Visual Discomfort Hours (VDH, hr)—for 2050 and 2080 climate scenarios. Using a synthetic dataset of approximately 3,700 building configurations (1,826 current, ~900 for 2050, ~1,000 for 2080, generated from EnergyPlus via jEPlus+EA), we pre-trained Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Network (DNN) models on present data and finetuned them with limited future samples (200–500). The models achieved R² values of 0.80–0.95 and reduced prediction times from hours (simulations) to seconds, with RMSE improvements of 10–20% over defaults. SHAP analysis identified dynamic ventilation (P9), efficient HVAC (e.g., VRF-DOAS, P25), and advanced insulation (e.g., RoofwithInsulationBatt244mm, P10) as primary drivers. Scenario analysis with 100 bootstrap iterations revealed trade-offs, such as high-resilience designs increasing PEC by up to 39% in 2080 while reducing PPD by up to 26%. Transfer learning enhanced efficiency, reducing retraining overhead significantly. Calibration metrics (e.g., NMBE <5%, CV(RMSE) <15%) were met, though limitations include synthetic data reliance and the need for real-world validation. This framework aids architects in designing climateresilient buildings toward net-zero by 2050. Future work includes real-time integration and multi-climate field studies.
