# Machine Learning for Building Performance Prediction

This study evaluates the effectiveness of six machine learning regression models—Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Linear Regression (LR)—for predicting building performance metrics under current climate conditions. Utilizing a synthetic dataset of 1,826 design configurations with 25 input variables, we analyzed five indicators: Primary Energy Consumption (kWh), CO2-equivalent Emissions (kg), Indoor Air Quality (IAQ, ppm), Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD, %), and Visual Discomfort Hours (VDH, hr). The dataset was standardized and split into training (60%) and testing (40%) sets. Model performance was assessed using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Coefficient of Determination (R2). Results showed that RF and XGBoost outperformed others, achieving test R2 values of 0.816 to 0.959, reducing RMSE by up to 31% compared to LR, which exhibited R2 values of 0.35 to 0.50. Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and Bayesian Optimization enhanced accuracy, with XGBoost achieving a test R2 of 0.959 for IAQ. Sensitivity and SHAP analyses identified key drivers of performance, including ventilation (Air Flow Rate) and HVAC systems. Scenario analysis, supported by uncertainty quantification through 1,000 bootstrap iterations, revealed trade-offs: Increased ventilation raised Primary Energy Consumption by 110.7% and CO2 emissions by 76.2%, yet improved IAQ by 20.3%. Moreover, optimization strategies effectively reduced Primary Energy Consumption by 34.3% and CO2 emissions by 38.1%, significantly enhancing occupant comfort metrics. Overall, RF and XGBoost, especially with optimized parameters, are robust tools for multi-objective optimization in sustainable building design.
